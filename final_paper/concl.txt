1. latent vs code synthesid: functionality to reproduce
2. Drawbacks of undifferantiable models
3. applying reinforcement learning might solve some limitaitons
4. sample starvation
5. Binary trees might be better for suiting solving such problem
6. Neural nets are 
7. latent represenatiton most likely is less powerfull to generating code, which is more of a NLP problem. differentiablity of all operations, lots of logic can be missed out
	7.1 very error prone, hard to debug, due to required flowing tesors in the model to have consistent
